S. Lewis recommended old books. By “old” he meant books that had been written centuries ago. He discussed his rule on reading new and old books in his introduction to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the Incarnation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Saint Athanasius [GLH Publishing Reprint, 2018].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is a good rule, after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between. If that is too much for you, you should at least read on old one to every three new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old books have been tested. They are much safer for the “amateur”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A new book is still on its trial and the amateur is not in a position to judge it. It has to be tested against the great body of Christian thought down the ages, and all its hidden implications (often unsuspected by the author himself) have to be brought to light.&lt;/p&gt;
